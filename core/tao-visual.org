** Fill column indicator

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Many modern editors and IDEs can graphically indicate the location of
  the fill column by drawing a thin line (in design parlance, a "rule") down
  the length of the editing window. Fill-column-indicator implements this
  facility in Emacs.

I really do care about text/code line width, so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(bundle! fill-column-indicator
  (setq fci-rule-column 90) ;; 90 is really ok
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'fci-mode)
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'fci-mode))
#+END_SRC
