#+TITLE: Emacs config

* Introduction

Personal Emacs configuration written with aims to learn Emacs-Lisp, Babel,
org-mode and, of course, build a perfect development enviroment.

Sources of inspiration:
- [[Oh My Emacs][https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs/]]
- [[https://github.com/nakkaya/emacs][https://github.com/nakkaya/emacs]]

The latest version is at https://github.com/saulius/dotemacs.

** Installation

1. Install Emacs 24.4+.
2. Checkout the distribution to your ~/.emacs.d directory:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd ~
    git clone http://github.com/saulius/dotemacs .emacs.d
    #+END_SRC
3. Launch Emacs!

** Package management

It uses the wonderful [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] package
manager. el-get allows package installation from various sources as well as
many other niceties.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  El-Get allows you to install and manage elisp code for Emacs. It supports
  lots of different types of sources and is able to install them, update
  them and remove them, but more importantly it will init them for you. That
  means it will require the features you need, load the necessary files,
  set the Info paths so that C-h i shows the new documentation you now
  depend on, and finally call your own initialisation code for you to setup
  the extension. Or call it a package.

#+END_QUOTE

It also uses small helper library called [[https://github.com/edvorg/req-package][req-package]]
for wrapping el-get calls and providing niceties of [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  req-package is a macro wrapper on top of use-package.
  Itâ€™s goal is to simplify package dependencies management,
  when using use-package for your .emacs.

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(el-get 'sync 'req-package)
(require 'req-package)
(package-initialize)
(setq req-package-providers '(req-package-try-el-get req-package-try-elpa))
#+END_SRC

** Structure

It consists of core modules and language specific modules. Core modules
reside in `core` directory, language specific modules are in `modules`
directory. `core` modules will be loaded by default. Language specific modes
are optional and can be loaded on demand.

Make sure all modules are loadable, extend `load-path` with relevant paths:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar config-dir user-emacs-directory
  "The dir where config lives.")
(defvar config-core-dir (expand-file-name "core" config-dir)
  "The dir where config core modules live.")
(defvar config-module-dir (expand-file-name "modules" config-dir)
  "The dir where config custom, language specific modules live.")
#+END_SRC

Load all core modules:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "core.org" config-core-dir))
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "editor.org" config-core-dir))
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "misc.org" config-core-dir))
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "o-org.org" config-core-dir))
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "navigation.org" config-core-dir))
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "visual.org" config-core-dir))
;; OSX specific config module
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "osx.org" config-core-dir)))
#+END_SRC

Load language modules:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "clojure.org" config-module-dir))
;;(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "markup.org" config-module-dir))
;;(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "ruby.org" config-module-dir))
#+END_SRC

Make req-package do its magic:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(req-package-finish)
#+END_SRC
